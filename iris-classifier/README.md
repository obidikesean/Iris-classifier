# Iris Classifier Project

This project trains a machine learning model using the Iris dataset to classify iris species based on flower measurements.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run training script:
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

3. **Output**: The script will print the model's accuracy, and save the trained model (`model.joblib`) and a confusion matrix plot (`confusion_matrix.png`) into the `/outputs` directory.
